# Applications and Frameworks

## Apps

### map.gl

Badge: Application

An interactive map explorer application


### vis-tutorials

Badge: Tutorials

Interactive tutorials to help you get started using the frameworks.


## Core Frameworks


### deck.gl

Badges: React-first

An highly performant WebGL2 based rendering framework for big data visualizations (> one million points) that integrates perfectly with reactive applications.


### react-map-gl

Badges: React-only

A comprehensive React wrapper for mapbox-gl. Designed to work seamlessly as a basemap for geospatial deck.gl visualizations, but can be used by any React application that needs to display a mapbox-gl map.


### react-vis

Badges: React-only

An extensive set of classic 2D SVG type visualizations packaged up as carefully designed React component. Many components are wrappers around D3 visualizations however there is a lot of additional custom logic that provides additional features.


### luma.gl

Badges: Pure JS

A comprehensive set of WebGL 2 components targeting high performance rendering and GPGPU computing.


### Tooling

### seer

Badges: Chrome Extension, Pure JS


### ocular

Badges: JS tooling

A framework for the frameworks. This is the tool that generates the beautiful websites used by the frameworks in this suite.



## Supporting Components

These are smaller components that have been created to support the core frameworks. While you may not initially need to deal with these frameworks, our aim is to make sure they all meet the same standards of documentation as the core frameworks should you need to work directly with them.

### math.gl

Badges: Pure JS

A compact, modern, and well documented library targeting the needs of 3D graphics and in particular luma.gl/deck.gl applications.


### mjolnir.js

Badges: Pure JS

Management of browser events and gestures in a portable, modern way.

Named as an homage to "Hammerjs" on which it is currently based.


### viewport-mercator-project

Badges: Pure JS

A library that collects 3D enabled web mercator projection math and tests.


## Associated Components

These are additional open source components produced by the Visualization team, currently not closely linked to/used by the rest of the frameworks in this suite.

Note that these components are not considered "promoted". This means that due to limitations on our time we will not provide a strong level of support on the components. Your issues and PRs might not receive a response.

We have still taken the somewhat controversial decision to make these frameworks open source in case it could serve as a basis for someone trying to solve problems similar to the ones we faced when creating these.


### monochrome

Badges: React-only, Unpromoted

A set of React components focusing on the needs of visualization applications (the "chrome" around a visualization).

### sub-redux

Badges: Pure JS, Unpromoted

A small system adding things like watchers, pluggable sub-stores and test utilities to redux.
